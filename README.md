Vihaan hackathon project: Let's do this.

# Ideas

Edit this file to state your ideas
As of now we have these:

- Cancer prediction (doc side)
- Google maps api for finding/calling nearest hospitals/ambulances
- Somehow send SOS messages to family members/friends in dire consequences/emergencies (cliched, but we have to do this)
- Login credentials and database to store it. Use MongoDB as Mohan is well versed in it.
- In case someone tests positive for a disease, we should not bluntly classify as malignant/benign. Instead, we should only advise whether to "Advised to see a doctor"/"Looks fine! Do consult a doctor for assurance". (APPLICABLE ONLY FOR PATIENT SIDE)
- Add voice recognition and google translate apis so that language barrier is removed



# Tools: 
- Python
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Google API
- Chat (doc-patient)
- Chatbot (Automated, AI)
- Alexa API (have to check if its partially free or not)
